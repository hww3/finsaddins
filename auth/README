This is a Fins controller and set of templates for providing user 
authentication in an application.

To make an entire controller accessible by authenticated users only,
you'd add the following to your controller:

static void start()
{
  before_filter(app->admin_user_filter);
}

Where admin_user_filter is a method that looks like:


int admin_user_filter(Fins.Request id, Fins.Response response, mixed ... args)
{
   if(!id->misc->session_variables->user)
   {
      response->flash("msg", "You must login to perform this action.");
      response->redirect(app->controller->auth->login, 0, ([ "return_to": id->not_query ]));
      return 0;
   }

   return 1;
}
